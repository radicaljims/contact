## Contact Geometry

### Overview

I propose the following: an introduction to contact geometry based on the first
few sections from Chapter 6 of McInerney's "First Steps in Differential
Geometry".

This includes a write-up summarizing the material, including some omitted
proofs, and a presentation to the class.

The high level overview is to begin with Huygen's model of point light sources
as a motivating example and then develop enough material to give the statement
of Darboux's theorem which says, roughly, that all contact geometries look
"locally" the same.

### Material Covered

I think mostly the material will be developed with R^2 in mind.

The write-up will cover:

1. Introduction. History: geometry as study of invariants. Huygen's model of point light sources. Envelopes of curves. Contact elements as pairs of points and non-vertical lines.
Differential forms as families of lines / planes. The contact 1-form. The
contact 1-form is invariant under diffeomorphism. The contact hyperplane.

2. Refining concepts. Plane fields. Contact forms and distributions. Integrable
   plane fields and Frobenius' theorem on non-integrability. Reeb fields /
   splitting vector fields.

3. Adding structure. Contact diffeomorphisms and contact vector fields. Flows on
   vector fields.

4. Summary. Flows of vector fields can be locally straightened. Darboux's Theorem.

The presentation will be a subset of the above material with the same goal of
ending with Darboux's Theorem.

It's not clear to me yet what the most accessible path through the material will
be for the presentation since I don't know the material myself yet. But I'll
work on that!

In addition to the write-up and presentation, at least the following will also
be provided:

Proofs and exercises:

1. A proof Proposition 6.1.3 (conditions for curves in R^2 to have a lift into a
curve on CR^2, the contact structure on R^2)

2. A proof of Proposition 6.1.4 (establishing a given map is a diffeomorphism)

3. A number of possible exercises are given in the end of the chapter
